"""
VGG19 is a pretrained neural network that expects coloured images. 
The output of the fourth cnn layer, prior to the fifth max-pooling layer of this network
is used as the output feature map. 

The HR and SR images are fed to the vgg19 network and the feature maps are then fed into the L2 loss function 
to obtain the VGG19loss.
