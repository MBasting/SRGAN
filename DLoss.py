Calculates the Dloss according to eq. 5 in the paper

discriminator outputs a single value between [0,1], where 1=real and 0=fake. 
The discriminator output is discretized(rounded) to classify an image as either real or fake.

for training the images are labeled as real or fake: Yhr=1 Ysr=0.

                # the cross entropy should approach zero for perfect discrimination. random discrimination should be 0.5 for both, summing to 1           
    #            d_loss = (d_loss_real + d_loss_fake)

            # here, fake is 0 if the discriminator is good.
