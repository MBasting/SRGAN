documentatation example from pytorch. 
from the example it can be seen that the first term in the loss function is the x value in the log.
the second term in the loss function is the target, which represents the y value. 

>>> m = nn.Sigmoid()
>>> loss = nn.BCELoss()
>>> input = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
>>> target = torch.empty(3).random_(2)
>>> output = loss(m(input), target)
>>> output.backward()
